### Hi there 👋

- 😄 I'm Sumanth, a software engineer at Anyscale, working on post-training. My primary interests are broadly in machine learning and systems engineering.
- 🚀 I'm trying to understand generative models, and have worked on finetuning and in-context learning for language models. Addicted to compute 🤖
- 💻  I'm currently working on [SkyThought](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyThought), and [SkyRL](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL).
- 🌱 I'm trying to learn what it takes to build machine learning systems in practice. 
- ✨ I have a blog: https://sumanthrh.com
- 💬 Some samples of my writing: 
  * Everything about distributed training and efficient finetuning: https://sumanthrh.com/post/distributed-and-efficient-finetuning/
  * Everything about tokenization (mini-course): https://github.com/SumanthRH/tokenization
