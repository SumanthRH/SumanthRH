### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ˜„ I'm Sumanth, a master's student in the CSE department at UC San Diego. My primary interests are broadly in machine learning and systems engineering.
- ğŸš€ I'm trying to understand generative models, and have worked on finetuning and in-context learning for language models. Addicted to compute ğŸ¤–
- ğŸ’» I've made open-source contributions to ğŸ¤— PEFT and Accelerate. 
- ğŸŒ± I'm trying to learn what it takes to build machine learning systems in practice. 
- âœ¨ I have a blog: https://sumanthrh.com
- ğŸ’¬ Some samples of my work:
  * Everything about distributed training and efficient finetuning: https://sumanthrh.com/post/distributed-and-efficient-finetuning/
  * Everything about tokenization: https://github.com/SumanthRH/tokenization
