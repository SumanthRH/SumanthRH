### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ˜„ I'm Sumanth, a software engineer at Anyscale, working on post-training. My primary interests are broadly in machine learning and systems engineering.
- ğŸš€ I'm trying to understand generative models, and have worked on finetuning and in-context learning for language models. Addicted to compute ğŸ¤–
- ğŸ’»  I'm currently building [SkyThought](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyThought).
- ğŸŒ± I'm trying to learn what it takes to build machine learning systems in practice. 
- âœ¨ I have a blog: https://sumanthrh.com
- ğŸ’¬ Some samples of my writing: 
  * Everything about distributed training and efficient finetuning: https://sumanthrh.com/post/distributed-and-efficient-finetuning/
  * Everything about tokenization (mini-course): https://github.com/SumanthRH/tokenization
